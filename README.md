# Use typescript to write a simple sorting algorithm
In this project I am going to write a sorting algorithm which will be used to sort arrays of various elements, including a linked list, using Typescript `interface`s.

The project uses npm package `concurrently` to start `tsc` compiler in watch mode (`tsc -w`) and restart the app with `nodemon build/index.js` every time that a change occurs.
